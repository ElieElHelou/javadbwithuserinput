## How to use the app
First, compile the java files then run.
Upon initialization, a message detailing the permissible commands will be displayed in the lobby:
    1)"-register" will prompt you for your info (email then username then password) then attempt to register your account in the DB.
    2)"-signin" will prompt you for your username and password then attempt to sign you in by verifying your credentials in the DB.
    3)"-quit" all purpose command that exits the app wherever you are.
Once signed in, any input will result in the message "<< User Activity >>", with the exception of "-signout" which will return you to the lobby.
